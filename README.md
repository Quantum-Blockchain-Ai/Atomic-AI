# Atomic Reach Developer Kit - API Libraries &amp; Prototypes

This collection of libraries allows you integrate with the **Atomic AI platform** and perform real-time text analysis from any application.

You will need an **API key** (OAuth2 consumer key and secret). If you don't have a key, please request it from our [website](https://www.atomicreach.com/).

## Prototype / Testing the API

Each library contains prototype files that you can use to test and benchmark the API before integrating with your app.

## [/JavaScript](https://github.com/siremi/Atomic-AI/tree/master/JavaScript)

AR JavaScript client and dependencies. The prototypes can be run stand alone and do not require a server.

Can be used to develop apps where the client connects directly to the Atomic AI platform.

# [/PHP/AR-Library](https://github.com/siremi/Atomic-AI/tree/master/PHP/AR-Library)

AR PHP Client library. Requires a server to run the PHP client. Can be used by Ajax apps.

# [/PHP/PECL-OAuth](https://github.com/siremi/Atomic-AI/tree/master/PHP/PECL-OAuth)

Prototype using the PECL OAuth PHP extension to connect to the Atomic AI platform. Requires less dependencies.
